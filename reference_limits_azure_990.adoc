Cloud Volumes ONTAP has storage configuration limits to provide reliable operations. For best performance, do not configure your system at the maximum values.

== Maximum system capacity by license

The maximum system capacity for a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system is determined by its license. The maximum system capacity includes disk-based storage plus object storage used for data tiering.

NetApp doesn't support exceeding the system capacity limit. If you reach the licensed capacity limit, Cloud Manager displays an action required message and no longer allows you to add additional disks.

|===
| License
| Maximum system capacity (disks + object storage)

| Freemium | 500 GB
| PAYGO Explore	| 2 TB (data tiering is not supported with Explore)
| PAYGO Standard | 10 TB
| PAYGO Premium | 368 TB
| Node-based license | 368 TB per license
| Capacity-based license | 2 PB

|===

===== For HA, is the license capacity limit per node or for the entire HA pair?

The capacity limit is for the entire HA pair. It is not per node. For example, if you use the Premium license, you can have up to 368 TB of capacity between both nodes.

== Disk and tiering limits by VM size

The disk limits below are specific to disks that contain user data. The limits do not include the root disk, core disk, and VNVRAM.

The tables below show the maximum system capacity by VM size with disks alone, and with disks and cold data tiering to object storage.

* Single node systems can use Standard HDD Managed Disks, Standard SSD Managed Disks, and Premium SSD Managed Disks, with up to 32 TB per disk. The number of supported disks varies by VM size.

* HA systems use Premium page blobs as disks, with up to 8 TB per page blob. The number of supported disks varies by VM size.

NOTE: You can purchase multiple node-based licenses for a Cloud Volumes ONTAP BYOL system to allocate more than 368 TB of capacity. The number of licenses that you can purchase for a single node system or HA pair is unlimited. Be aware that disk limits can prevent you from reaching the capacity limit by using disks alone. You can go beyond the disk limit by http://docs.netapp.com/occm/us-en/concept_data_tiering.html[tiering inactive data to object storage^]. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/occm/task_managing_licenses.html[Learn how to add additional system licenses to Cloud Volumes ONTAP^].

== Aggregate limits

Cloud Volumes ONTAP uses Azure storage as disks and groups them into _aggregates_. Aggregates provide storage to volumes.

[cols=2*,options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Parameter
| Limit

| Maximum number of aggregates | Same as the disk limit
| Maximum aggregate size ^1^ |
384 TB of raw capacity for single node ^2^
352 TB of raw capacity for single node with PAYGO
96 TB of raw capacity for HA pairs
| Disks per aggregate	| 1-12 ^3^
| Maximum number of RAID groups per aggregate	| 1
|===

Notes:

. The aggregate capacity limit is based on the disks that comprise the aggregate. The limit does not include object storage used for data tiering.

. If using node-based licensing, two BYOL licenses are required to reach 384 TB.

. All disks in an aggregate must be the same size.

== Storage VM limits

Some configurations enable you to create additional storage VMs (SVMs) for Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

These are the tested limits. While it is theoretically possible to configure additional storage VMs, it's not supported.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/occm/task_managing_svms_azure.html[Learn how to create additional storage VMs^].

[cols=2*,options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| License type
| Storage VM limit

| *PAYGO* a|
* 1 storage VM for serving data
* 1 storage VM for disaster recovery

| *Freemium* a|
24 storage VMs total ^1,2^

| *Capacity-based license* ^3^ a|
24 storage VMs total ^1,2^

| *Node-based BYOL* ^4^ a|
24 storage VMs total ^1,2^

|===

. These 24 storage VMs can serve data or be configured for disaster recovery (DR).

. Each storage VM can have up to three LIFs where two are data LIFs and one is an SVM management LIF.

. For capacity-based licensing, there are no extra licensing costs for additional storage VMs, but there is a 4 TB minimum capacity charge per storage VM. For example, if you create two storage VMs and each has 2 TB of provisioned capacity, you'll be charged a total of 8 TB.

. For node-based BYOL, an add-on license is required for each additional _data-serving_ storage VM beyond the first storage VM that comes with Cloud Volumes ONTAP by default. Contact your account team to obtain a storage VM add-on license.
+
Storage VMs that you configure for disaster recovery (DR) don't require an add-on license (they are free of charge), but they do count against the storage VM limit. For example, if you have 12 data-serving storage VMs and 12 storage VMs configured for disaster recovery, then you've reached the limit and can't create any additional storage VMs.

== File and volume limits

[cols="22,22,56",width=100%,options="header"]
|===
| Logical storage
| Parameter
| Limit

.2+| *Files*	| Maximum size | 16 TB
| Maximum per volume |	Volume size dependent, up to 2 billion
| *FlexClone volumes*	| Hierarchical clone depth ^2^ | 499
.3+| *FlexVol volumes*	| Maximum per node |	500
| Minimum size |	20 MB
| Maximum size |
Azure HA: Dependent on the size of the aggregate ^3^
Azure single node: 100 TB
| *Qtrees* |	Maximum per FlexVol volume |	4,995
| *Snapshot copies* |	Maximum per FlexVol volume |	1,023

|===

Notes:

. Cloud Manager does not provide any setup or orchestration support for SVM disaster recovery. It also does not support storage-related tasks on an additional SVM. You must use System Manager or the CLI for SVM disaster recovery.

* https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_get_file/ECMLP2839857[SVM Disaster Recovery Express Guide^]

. Hierarchical clone depth is the maximum depth of a nested hierarchy of FlexClone volumes that can be created from a single FlexVol volume.

. Less than 100 TB is supported for this configuration because aggregates on HA pairs are limited to 96 TB of _raw_ capacity.
