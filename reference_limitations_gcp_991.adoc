== Google Private Service Connect limitations

If you leverage https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/private-service-connect[Google Private Service Connect^] within the VPC that you are deploying Cloud Volumes ONTAP into, you will need to implement DNS records that forward traffic to the required https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/occm/task_creating_connectors_gcp.html#enabling-google-cloud-apis[Cloud Manager API Endpoints^].

Using FabricPools/Tiering from Cloud Volumes ONTAP into Google Cloud Storage buckets is not currently supported with Private Service Connect.
