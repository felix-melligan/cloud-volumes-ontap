Several Cloud Volumes ONTAP configurations are supported in Azure.

== Supported configurations by license

Cloud Volumes ONTAP is available in Azure as a single node system and as a high-availability (HA) pair of nodes for fault tolerance and nondisruptive operations.

Upgrading a single node system to an HA pair is not supported. If you want to switch between a single node system and an HA pair, then you need to deploy a new system and replicate data from the existing system to the new system.

=== Single node systems

You can choose from the following configurations when deploying Cloud Volumes ONTAP as a single-node system in Azure:

| Supported disk types ^5^ 6+| Standard HDD Managed Disks, Standard SSD Managed Disks, and Premium SSD Managed Disks

|===

Notes:

. Data tiering to Azure Blob storage isn't supported with PAYGO Explore.

. This VM type uses an https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/disks-enable-ultra-ssd[Ultra SSD^] for VNVRAM, which provides better write performance.

. This VM is recommended only when Azure maintenance control is needed. It's not recommended for any other use case due to the higher pricing.

. This VM type includes local NVMe storage, which Cloud Volumes ONTAP uses as _Flash Cache_. Flash Cache speeds access to data through real-time intelligent caching of recently read user data and NetApp metadata. It is effective for random read-intensive workloads, including databases, email, and file services. Compression must be disabled on all volumes to take advantage of the Flash Cache performance improvements. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/occm/concept_flash_cache.html[Learn more^].

. Enhanced write performance is enabled when using SSDs, but not when using the DS3_v2 virtual machine type.

. For Azure region support, see https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-global-regions[Cloud Volumes Global Regions^].

. Cloud Volumes ONTAP can run on either a Reserved or On-demand VM instance from your cloud provider. Solutions that use other VM instance types aren't supported.

=== HA pairs

You can choose from the following configurations when deploying Cloud Volumes ONTAP as an HA pair in Azure.

Notes:

. Cloud Volumes ONTAP supports high write speed with these VM types when using an HA pair. High write speed is supported with all instance types when using a single node system. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/occm/concept_write_speed.html[Learn more about choosing a write speed^].

. This VM is recommended only when Azure maintenance control is needed. It's not recommended for any other use case due to the higher pricing.

. PAYGO Explore isn't supported with HA pairs in Azure.

. For Azure region support, see https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-global-regions[Cloud Volumes Global Regions^].

. Cloud Volumes ONTAP can run on either a Reserved or On-demand VM instance from your cloud provider. Solutions that use other VM instance types aren't supported.

== Supported disk sizes

In Azure, an aggregate can contain up to 12 disks that are all the same type and size.
